Hello! I'm Hilbert Lam (林潤然). I am a biology student. My main overarching interests are in computer-aided drug design (CADD) and applying AI to biology. I work rather extensively in this field and am familiar with the virtual screening and drug discovery pipelines. I have published in this field and am actively working on expanding its frontiers.

In addition to CADD, I have experience in creating biomedical imaging AI (specifically optical coherence tomography segmentation AIs), analysing bioinformatics data and doing wet lab experiments. My wet lab experience was mainly in microbiology and doing RT-PCR. My exposure to AI started in 2017, when I coded a small neural network library in JavaScript from scratch and experimented with GANs and LSTMs in TensorFlow (I mainly use PyTorch now).

Finding new therapeutics interest me the most. At the end of the day, nothing makes me happier than knowing something I designed *in silico* has an actual effect in the real world. After all, streamlining drug discovery is in itself a stride in improving the scientific understanding of systems biology.

As you can probably tell, my interests and experiences are a little all over the place. I find that sometimes doing work that is just slightly out of scope stimulates my brain biochemistry enough to symbiotically cross-talk with my core interests. That is to say - if you have project ideas, do reach out and I would be delighted to discuss them.

I am Chinese Singaporean, born and raised in Singapore. As of now, I am an incoming PhD student (starting in Michaelmas 2025) at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of Professor Michele Vendruscolo. Previously, I received a diploma (associate degree equivalent) in Biomedical Science from Singapore Polytechnic and a Bachelor of Science (Honours) degree from Nanyang Technological University.
